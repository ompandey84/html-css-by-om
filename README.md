# html-css-by-om
A growing collection of HTML and CSS code created while learning—meant to help others understand the basics through real examples.

Got it! Since this repository is for **learning HTML & CSS** (not a project), I'll create a **README.md** that reflects its purpose as a **learning resource** with a clean, structured format.
